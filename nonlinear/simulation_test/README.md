Open ``simulation_test.R``


It is a simple simulation test with the tuning procedure (Model I-1 and III-1). In the orgiinal article, the tuning parameters and dimensions are chosen based on the average of 10 samples. In this test R file, only one simulation sample is used to get the tuning/dimension.

The codes have been written inefficinetly and have not yet been updated since 2015.
